# Smelter colors

This loads a minimal Smelter Pipeline to show the color difference between the image and mp4 from `./assets`.

The output is saved to:
- `output_png.png`: a single output frame from when the image is rendered
- `output_mp4.png`: a single output frame from when the mp4 is rendered
- `output.mp4`: a 5 seconds video swithing between the two every second

## Usage

```bash
cargo run
```
